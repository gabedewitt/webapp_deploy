*"Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your bodyâ€™s cells for use as energy. If you have diabetes, your body either doesnâ€™t make enough insulin or canâ€™t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isnâ€™t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease." - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)*

Diabetes is a chronic disease in which blood glucose levels are too high. The total or partial absence of insulin interferes not only with the burning of sugar but also with its transformation into other substances like protein, muscle and fat.

There are 3 main types of diabetes:

- **Type 1 diabetes**: It comprises approximately 5 to 10% of people who have diabetes. This type of diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body mistakenly attacks itself) causing the pancreas to produce little or no insulin. In general, the symptoms appear quickly and the installation of the disease occurs more in children, adolescents and young adults. These people are insulin-dependent, that is, they require daily injections of insulin to survive. Currently, nobody knows how to prevent this type of diabetes.

- **Type 2 diabetes**: It is the most common type of diabetes, representing 90 - 95% of all cases. With type 2 diabetes you may not feel any symptoms so it is important to test your blood sugar levels. In this case the cells are resistant to the action of insulin. This type of diabetes is predictable and preventable because it is a process that evolves over many years as a result of lifestyle (eg, low physical activity, obesity level) and others (eg, age, gender, race, family history) risk factors. It is usually diagnosed in adults. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes.

- **Gestational diabetes**: It occurs during pregnancy and, in most cases, is caused by the mother's excessive weight gain. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, but it increases the risk that the mother will have type 2 diabetes later on. If it is not properly controlled, it increases the risk that the child will suffer diabetes or obesity in the future.

The *Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System* (BRFSS) is a health-related telephone survey that is collected annually by the CDC for U.S. residents. For this project, we used the data available for the year 2015 in [this repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) to analyze the characteristics of the following 3 categories: people without diabetes or only during pregnancy, prediabetic people and people with diabetes. We also built a Machine Learning model considering only 2 balanced categories: respondents with no diabetes and with either prediabetes or diabetes. Due to its high sensitivity/detection rate (75%), our LGBM model can provide reasonable initial population screening for diabetes at a lower data cost.""")
